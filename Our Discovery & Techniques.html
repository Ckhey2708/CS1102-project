        <h1>CS1102 Project (2024-2025 Semester A)</h1>
        <h2>Tue 18:00 - 18:50 Project Group 2</h2>
        <h3>Our Discovery</h3>
        <p>Compared to conventional training techniques, participants showed greater retention of fire safety knowledge and abilities through immersive experiences. Users can experience and comprehend the dynamics of fire crises without the hazards by simulating real-life fire escape scenarios in a safe virtual setting. Including interactive features (such as selecting objects or setting off alarms) can further improve users' comprehension of fire safety procedures and promote involvement. </p>
        <p>Participants gain emotional and psychological readiness for actual emergencies by going through a simulated fire scenario, which promotes calmness and logical decision-making under pressure. The VR simulation is a flexible tool for fire safety training in a multitude of circumstances. It enables people with busy schedules or mobility impairments to take part in fire drills, boosting general awareness and readiness across a wide range of demographics. </p>
        <p>After the simulation offers insightful feedback, it's crucial to include a rating system that enables participants to evaluate their performance and pinpoint areas in need of development. To optimize authenticity and the VR experience overall, point out areas that need improvement in the interim, such as enhancing interaction with particular features and enhancing the sensory experience (sound effects, visual signals, etc.). </p>
