        <h3>Recommendation to VR Fire Escape Simulation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Controlling the virtual reality fire escape scenario is difficult. It is recommended that instructions are given to participants on how to operate the VR headset and controller; each controller function should be illustrated so that users are aware of how to use it. </li>
            <li>The general atmosphere feels overly stale. To improve immersion and make the scene seem more realistic, it is advised to include more dynamic sound effects, such as fire crackling, alarms blaring, people yelling, and visual elements, such as smoke and flashing lights. </li>
            <li>It is advised to make sure the fire extinguisher is one that is easily picked up and utilized. This could indicate that the interaction scripts that retrieve the extinguisher and subsequently trigger it need to be modified. When the extinguisher is used, provide a suitable, audible or visual signal so that the user may quickly assess its efficacy. </li>
            <li>One problem with the VR fire escape simulation at the moment is that keys and wet towels can fit inside the bags but not be deployed. Ensure that each item the user selects has a function in the simulation and isn't just ornamental. The wet towel might be employed in the event of a fire or smoke hazard, and it is proposed that the keys could also be used to unlock certain doors or locations.  </li>
            <li>Having the summary session after the users have finished the game is preferable. Reaction times and the precision of the users' selections may be documented during the summary session. In conclusion, users might be more aware of the skills they lack throughout the escape experience and perform better the next time. </li>
            <li>Including a variety of locations in the virtual reality fire escape simulation is recommended. The simulation is currently only utilized in residential settings. Visitors can better understand diverse environments by exposing them to a variety of scenarios, such as those found in offices and shopping centers. Assist them recognize the appropriate course of action to take in different circumstances. Enabling the efficient operation of participants in the case of a fire outbreak. </li>
