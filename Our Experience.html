        <h3>Our Experience with VR Fire Escape Simulation</h3>
        <h4>Experience on simulation</h4>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Starting the escape</li>
            <p>Participants are given a VR headset and two controllers so they can immerse themselves as the avatar in the fire escape simulation. Users find themselves in a room as soon as they enter the virtual environment. Five items are arranged for you to choose from within the room: a wet towel, cash, keys, a passport, and a cell phone. </p>
            <p>Participants can select two items that should be in your carry-on at all times: mobile phone in case of an emergency or to sound the alarm; door-opening keys and access points that are secure to employ while seeking shelter. When coping with smoke, a wet towel can be utilized as a mask. </p>
            <li>Escape process</li>
            <p>Following the selection of evacuation items, participants can proceed to a door behind them to enter the hallway and begin the fire escape procedure. It is possible to see a neighbor's doorway across the hall from yours. Users can knock and warn their neighbor to evacuate when interaction with the door is enabled. This serves as a crucial component for alerting people in the event of an ignition. </p>
            <p>There is a fire alarm that people can engage with as they proceed down the corridor. This is a crucial component of the simulation since setting off the fire alarm not only notifies other residents but also provides time for those involved to call the fire service for assistance in real life. </p>
            <p>Users will be able to witness an underlying fire burning beneath the stairs after participants reach the stairways. A fire extinguisher is within reach on their right. The fire that has been obstructing the path can subsequently be extinguished by the participants using the fire extinguisher. This demonstrates how crucial fire extinguishers are for putting out tiny fires during an emergency. </p>
            <li>Ending the escape</li>
            <p>Users can proceed down the stairs and make their way to the building's exit once the fire has been extinguished. The participants have now securely departed the premises and successfully navigating the fire escape. </p>
        </ol>
        <h4>After-thought</h4>
        <p>Fire escape simulation is an effective experience all around. The practice allowed users to experience a fire escape scenario firsthand, closely simulating the real-world event. Important elements of fire escape protocols were introduced by the simulation, such as the extinguisher, fire alarm, and three helpful objects in case of a fire. More significantly, the exercise demonstrated how one ought to maneuver through a possible fire situation. </p>
        <p>Users are given instructions and guidance to aid them through the drill during the simulation. These guidelines work as lessons to help users comprehend what should be done in certain situations. This is essential for users to gain insight and respond appropriately in actual-life circumstances. </p>
        <p>After the simulation concludes, a rating system is also offered. Users will be able to examine their overall performance and verify their scores. Participants are able to reflect on their fire escape techniques and improve on their areas of vulnerability in the future. Ensuring that participants are capable of handling various severe conditions. </p>
        <p>Overall, compared to a conventional fire escape drill, the VR fire escape simulation allows users to participate considerably more actively. Traditional fire escape drills offer a passive learning environment, whereas virtual reality simulations offer an active one. Users' attention is maintained throughout the entire process by the VR simulation, which offers superior efficiency. </p>
